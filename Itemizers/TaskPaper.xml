	<!--
	The same downsides as are in the first-party Python.sugar exist for this one:
	
	- Itemizers are not nested because <end-selector> is not checked for subrecipes
	- The "x-item-body" approach, however, is necessary or else folding the project will hide absolutely everything and nested projects end up selecting their leading whitespace
	
	There's no real good fix for this, so here's hoping that Espresso starts checking end-selector for recipes down the road; I'm not willing to take the other trade-offs at the moment (particularly since I rarely have any nested projects)
